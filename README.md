# Overview

I wanted to familiarize myself with Django, so I knew what it was and the basics of how it works.

I decided to use the tutorial on w3 schools to start off with. I soon realized that the w3 tutorial was missing some pieces on the install and that is when I went to a YouTube video to learn how to set up the Django environment.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

I found out that I needed to go back to the basics for this and just learn as best as I could in the time allotted since I ran into a ton of errors along the way.  
I have a Home page, Members page, and Detailed members page.

# Development Environment

I used html, css, Django, venv, python, python shell, Django administration, runserver, pythonanywhere.com
